What is the value of artistic appeal in a website?
You want people to like your website so they want to return to it and tell people about it. If it looks good people will trust your site more and take your site more seriously.

Do most people consider the same things attractive in web sites?
There are the basic Principals of Good Design, which is always a good place to start (rule of 3rds, complimentary colors, how the eye flows on a website in comparison to how you lay out your website, etc.). You really need to understand the base rules before you are allowed to break them, if that is ultimately what you want to do.

How do you build a site that is attractive to your audience?
By knowing your audience. Obviously a rock band website is going to want to have a much different feel than a website for a classical music website. Usually those audiences are very different and will appreciate different properties in different ways.
