		<h2>Here is what one student had to say about programming:</h2>

		<blockquote>"I never thought I could consider programming as a career. It always looked so complicated. After taking Programming 1, I realize this could be a viable career. I have coded multiple programs using the C# programming language. It was actually a lot of fun!"</blockquote>

		<p>ECS is designed to introduce students to the breadth of the field of computer science through an exploration of engaging and accessible topics. Rather than focusing the entire course on learning particular software tools or programming languages, the course is designed to focus the conceptual ideas of computing and help students understand why certain tools or languages might be utilized to solve particular problems. The goal of Exploring Computer Science is to develop in students the computational thinking practices of algorithm development, problem  solving and programming within the context of problems that are relevant to the lives of todayâ€™s students. Students will also be introduced to topics such as interface design, limits of computers and societal and ethical issues.

		<p>An introductory course in computer programming/software engineering and applications. The course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming. Students will learn to design, code, and test their own programs while applying mathematical concepts. Teachers introduce concepts and problem solving skills to beginning students through a programming language such as:
		</p>

		<ul id="circleList">
			<li>C++</li> 
			<li>C#</li> 
			<li>Java</li> 
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		The second half of the year reviews and builds on the concepts introduced in the first semester. This semester introduces students to more complex data structures and their uses, including sequential files, arrays, and classes. Students will learn to create more powerful programs.
