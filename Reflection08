How do you use CSS to turn every odd line in a table to a different background color?
	You use the "n-th child" command to call out every "xth" row when you creat the CSS rule. 

	table tr:nth-child(even) {
		background-color:red;
	}

How would explain an iframe to a non technical person?
	It is "website inception". A website within a website.

Why don't drop-down menus work well on phones and tablets?
	Because you can hover over things on a computer with your mouse, which would trigger the drop-down, but on mobile you really only have the option to tap and you would run out of space quickly if you tapped, had a dropdown, and had to figure out how to scroll or choose an option from the dropdown.
